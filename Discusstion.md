excerpt: 'This article delves into the intricate landscape of portrait and reputation rights within the realms of two prominent Chinese social platformsâ€”Zhihu and Xiaohongshu. Examining the user-generated content policies and privacy protection measures of Zhihu, we unravel the platform's stance on issues surrounding personal identity and reputation. On the other hand, a spotlight on Xiaohongshu, with its emphasis on lifestyle content and e-commerce, offers insights into how portrait and reputation rights intersect with consumer behavior and influencer dynamics. By exploring real-life cases and legal compliance on both platforms, this article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and safeguards associated with these fundamental rights in the digital age'
