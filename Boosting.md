excerpt: 'We herein report the preparation using a molten salt method. The prepared materials were employed for the electrochemical determination of paracetamol (PCM). Carbon-doping significantly improved the electrocatalytic activity of BN nanosheets, exhibiting excellent analytical properties in the detection of PCM. The developed sensor also performed well in real sample assays. In this project, my primary responsibilities include synthesizing the substrate, separating and purifying products, determining product structures, and studying the dynamic process of the reaction.'
