collection: publications
permalink: /publications/2024-01-Scaling-Vision-from-Face-to-Action-for-Multimodal-Affective-Computing
excerpt: 'We first propose considering the action information for Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) to identify human affective states. Furthermore, we argue that exploiting action information faces two challenges: credibility and sparsity. To address this, our paper proposes a new approach, Trusted Action-Enhanced Curriculum Learning (TACL), to incorporate action information for enhancing MAC.'
